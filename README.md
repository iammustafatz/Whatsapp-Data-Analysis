# Whatsapp Data Analysis

WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform messaging and voice-over-IP service owned by Meta Platforms. In this project, I have analyzed the text data exported from a WhatsApp group chat to solve the following tasks:


This project involves analyzing the exported text data of a WhatsApp group chat to solve various tasks:

1. Find the list of unique members who have interacted at least once in this group.
2. Design a function named conversation_by_date(file, date) that extracts the entire conversation that happened on a particular date in the DD/MM/YYYY format. This function takes two arguments: the file (a text file that contains the WhatsApp chat conversation) and the date.
3. Design a function named conversation_by_person(file, person) that extracts all the posts done by a particular person. This function takes two arguments: the file and the person of interest.
4. Determine which part of the day (AM or PM) experiences the most conversation in the group.
5. Find the frequency distribution of the hours.
6. Design a function named avg_length_by_person(file, person) that gets the average length of the messages posted by a particular person. This function takes two arguments: the file and the person of interest.


These tasks are carried out using text analysis techniques. By analyzing WhatsApp chat data, we can extract valuable insights that can be useful for various purposes, such as identifying the most active members of a group or determining the time of the day when most conversations take place.
