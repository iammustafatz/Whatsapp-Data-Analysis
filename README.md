#### 1.Find the list of unique members who has interacted at least once in this group.

#### 2.Design a function named conversation_by_date(file,date)that will help us to extract the entire conversation which happened on a particular date.As shown,this function should take two arguments:

*   file: A text file that contains the WhatsApp chat conversation
*   date: A date of interest DD/MM/YYYY format.

#### 3.Design a function named conversation_by_person(file,person) that will help us to extract all the posts done by a particular person. As shown, this function should take two arguments:

*   person: A person of interest

#### 4.Which part of the day (AM or PM) does this group experience most conversation?

#### 5.Find the frequency distribution of the hours...?

#### 6.Design a function named avg_length_by_person(file,person)that will help us to get the average length of the messages posted by a particular person.As shown,this function should take two arguments:
